# CONTROLLER
There are two primary controllers used: one to slow down the rotation of the satellite (detumbler) and one to orient the satellite. Both rely on a magnetorquer. 

## Detumbler 
In order to slow the rotation of the satellite, the magnetorquer is used to generate a torque in opposition to the rotation of the satellite. There are a few different variations of this controller (B dot, B cross, and a bang-bang style).
